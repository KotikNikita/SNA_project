# Islands and Main Path Approach
This repository will contain the code for implementing the [Islands](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/Doc/Sunbelt/islands.pdf) and [Main Path Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0309023.pdf) algorithms on python 3. It is also planned to present the results of applying the algorithm on the Patent citation network and compare them with the results from the article.  
+ The Islands algorithm allows you to select communities in the graph. It is named because, in fact, it gradually changes the value of the numerical parameter and communities are gradually formed and united. By analogy with how many small islands would unite with each other if the level of the world's oceans began to decline
+ Main Path Approach is based on the calculation of special coefficients (NPPC, SPC, SPP). After their calculation, the most important paths from the point of view of these coefficients are found. Such paths are especially interesting when studying citation networks  
It is also interesting to apply the above algorithms together to study the structure of individual islands
